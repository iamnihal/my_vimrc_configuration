# VIMRC File
This is my vim configuration file with no bullshit plugins and settings.

I refrain from using any kind of code-completion engine as it just makes vim to respond slow. Vim is known for its fast and efficient text editing and I am still looking for a reliable plugin that doesn't makes vim a slow text-editor.
